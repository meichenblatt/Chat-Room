## Chat Room App

This is my submission for my Capstone Project in the Senior Web Development Nanodegree by Udacity. 

I used AngularJS as the framework and Gulp as the build process.

This Project focuses on:
* Responsive Design
* Input Design
* Offline Functionality
* Accessibility Standards
* Home Screen Installable
* Progressive Web features like push notifications and geolocation


## Getting Started

In the root directory of the app run:

```
$ npm install
```

For developer mode:

```
$ gulp
```

For production mode:

```
$ gulp serve:dist
```

Enjoy!
